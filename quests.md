# ðŸ§™ Quests

## Introduction

Quests are a fundamental component of the Charisma Creatures yield farming platform. Deployed as smart contracts, Quests allow users to tap into the energy generated by their creatures and earn rewards. Each Quest is designed to offer a unique and engaging experience, combining various mechanics to make yield farming more rewarding, fun, and superior to traditional methods.

### Key Concepts

#### 1. Quests

Quests are smart contracts that define specific tasks and conditions under which users can engage their creatures to earn rewards. Each Quest has unique mechanics, goals, and rewards, providing a diverse range of activities for users to participate in.

#### 2. Creature Energy

Creature Energy is the core resource generated by creatures over time. This energy can be tapped during Quests to perform actions, complete tasks, and earn rewards. The amount of energy a creature generates depends on its power and the time elapsed since the last energy tap.

#### 3. Rewards

Rewards are the incentives earned by users for participating in Quests. These can include additional tokens, rare items, and other valuable assets within the Charisma ecosystem. Rewards vary based on the complexity and difficulty of each Quest.

### How Quests Work

#### 2. Participating in Quests

* Users can choose from a variety of available Quests.
* To participate, users need to tap into their creature's energy and follow the Questâ€™s specific requirements.

#### 3. Completing Quests

* Each Quest has a set of tasks or conditions that need to be fulfilled.

* Upon successful completion of a Quest, the smart contract issues the defined rewards to the user.
