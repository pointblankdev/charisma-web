# ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

### Introduction

Charisma is a community-run protocol built on the Stacks blockchain, leveraging Bitcoin's security. It operates with full on-chain governance where community members holding the governance token (CHA) can influence the development and operations of the project by voting on proposals. These proposals are executed automatically via smart contracts, ensuring decentralized and transparent decision-making.

#### Governance in Charisma DAO

Charisma DAO allows its community to propose and vote on various changes, upgrades, and initiatives. Proposals can cover a wide range of topics, including platform upgrades, new features, economic adjustments, and community initiatives. All proposals that receive majority approval are automatically implemented by the smart contracts.

**Types of Proposals**:

* **Governance Proposals**: Modifications to the governance structure or voting mechanisms.
* **Economic Proposals**: Adjustments to tokenomics, staking rewards, or introducing new economic incentives.
* **Development Proposals**: New features or improvements to the DAOâ€™s infrastructure.
* **Community Proposals**: Initiatives for community engagement, marketing, or partnerships.

#### Steps in Creating a Proposal

1. **Create an Extension**: Extensions are smart contracts that add new features or functionalities to the DAO. Developers can refer to existing extensions for guidance.
2. **Deploy and Test**: Deploy the extension contract to the Stacks mainnet and conduct rigorous testing in a sandbox environment.
3. **Create the Proposal Contract**: Develop a proposal contract outlining the details of the extension and its activation parameters. Deploy this to the Stacks mainnet after successful testing.
4. **Submit for Voting**: Use the "propose" function of the proposal submission contract to introduce the proposal. The voting period typically lasts around 10 days.
5. **Conclude the Proposal**: If the proposal passes, use the "conclude" function to execute the contract and enable the extension.

#### Creatures

Charisma Creatures is an advanced yield farming platform within the Charisma ecosystem, utilizing unique semi-fungible tokens (SFTs). Creatures can be summoned, managed, and tapped for energy to participate in Quests, providing a dynamic and engaging yield farming experience.
